# Puck.js Temperature Monitor

A simple temperature checker using a Puck.js to check the temperature in a room and blink different colors depending on the temperature. My wife uses this to check the temperature in our baby's room at night to make sure it's an okay temperature for the baby.

### Deploying the app

- Purchase a Puck.js and follow the set-up instructions [here](https://www.puck-js.com/)
- Go to the [online IDE](https://www.espruino.com/ide/) and enter the JavaScript code
- Start the app by sending the code via Bluetooth to the Puck.js
- Press the Puck's built-in button, and watch it work!

### Interpretation of colors
- Green: okay temperature
- Red: too hot
- Blue: too cold
